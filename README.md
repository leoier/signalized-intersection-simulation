# Traffic Simulation in Two-Lane Intersection with Traffic Light Using Cellular Automata

Simulation program for a two-lane two-way signalized intersection based on cellular automata.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.10** - Follow instructions to install python 3.10 for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.10/using/)

2. **NumPy** - Follow instructions to install NumPy for your platform in the [NumPy docs](https://numpy.org/install/)

## Run the Simulation
To run the simulation, execute:
```bash
python3 src/sim.py
```
The default simulation parameters are set in [src/sim.py](./src/sim.py). The simulation results such as space-time diagrams and statistics will be saved in the `output` folder.
